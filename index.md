# WhosLobbying

WhosLobbying.com is no longer active. It was an experiment to make it simple to find information on UK lobbying and public affairs.

WhosLobbying.com was a site to access aggregated publicly accessible data about lobbying activity in the UK without having to poke around through dense, difficult-to-navigate websites and hard to find PDF documents.
